**[Tcl](http://www.tcl.tk)** (Tool Command Language) is a dynamic scripting language that is easily embedded in other applications. **[Tk](http://www.tkdocs.com)** is a cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit. Both are useable from within R thanks to the [tcltk package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/tcltk/html/tcltk-package.html). The Tk toolkit is a decent one, but not the most feature-rich. However, the big advantage of Tcl/Tk is its wide availability in all platforms supported by R: the package is maintained by the R Core Team, and it is shipped with R itself. To check if Tcl/Tk is available, use the command `capabilities("tcltk")`.

The [tcltk2]() package is also available from [CRAN](). It offers additional possibilities and more widgets. These recipes show how to use both the tcltk and the tcltk2 packages with R to build a GUI, or to use other potentials of Tcl.
